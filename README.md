Cooperative Breakout
===================

Project for the Mobile Computing Systems Programming module.

Player controls a paddle to prevent a ball from going pass them. Ball is 
bounced off paddle to destroy blocks. Player is scored based on time taken 
to destroy all blocks.

In multiplayer, a single set of blocks are placed in the center. 2 Players 
will then control their own paddles and balls from a side each. The 
objective is to either make your opponent drop any of the 2 balls, or to
clear the most number of blocks. The game ends when all blocks are cleared or
when a player drops a ball.
